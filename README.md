# MBTA Parking Map

## What does this do?

This is a webapp that shows MBTA parking lot information on a single map, with capacity and rate information.

You can:

- View map on the screen with different orientations, or print (Mapbox restriction applies)
- View clustered data with min/max rate or capacity
- Filter by transit lines
